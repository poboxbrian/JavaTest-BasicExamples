/*
Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm

Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, â€¦, n).
Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
Starting from p, count up in increments of p and mark each of these 
    numbers greater than p itself in the list. These numbers will be 
    2p, 3p, 4p, etc.; note that some of them may have already been 
    marked.
Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. 
    If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal 
    this number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
